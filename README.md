## Motivation

In order to connect the BrandMaker modules _Marketing Planner_ and _Job Manager_ with 3rd party applications, the integration with the Dell Boomi platform is offered.

## Scope

This repository contains a connector example for the iPaaS platform Dell Boomi. The connector is able to retrieve BrandMaker Marketing Planner Nodes and filter them as well as create new Workflow Jobs in BrandMaker Job Manager. NOt all available API end points of these modules are implemented as this is mainly an example on how to implement a more specific connector.
